                <h5>Landing</h5>
                <p> In the distant future, tens of thousands of years beyond the Anthropocene, the Earth had transformed into a utopian landscape, 
                    sculpted by the passage of time and the wisdom of its inhabitants. At the summit of a great mountain, where once climbers had 
                    risked their lives for a fleeting moment of glory, an ethereal calm now reigned. It was here that a swirling portal shimmered 
                    into existence, its iridescent colors a stark contrast to the stark white snow and piercing blue skies. From the vortex emerged Kai, 
                    a time traveler hailing from a distant utopian era, his eyes wide with wonder and uncertainty. 
                </p>

                <h5>Descent</h5>
                <p> He was hurled through a portal to the summit of a great mountain. As he gained his feet, he watched helplessly as the portal closed behind him. 
                    Kai was ill-prepared for the extreme cold and harsh conditions. 
                    Despite the overwhelming feeling of dread, Kai knew that he had no choice but to descend the treacherous slopes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p> As he made his way down, Kai encountered haunting remnants of a bygone era. Frozen mountaineers lay as if trapped in time, 
                    their faces contorted with pain and fear. Plastic tents and discarded gas canisters littered the landscape, telling a story of humanity's 
                    relentless pursuit of achievement. Kai felt a deep sadness but knew he had to push on. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p> The bitter cold cut through his thin clothing and chilled him to the bone, 
                    but through his movement he could push life throughout his limbs. Even so, 
                    his descent was slow, and he began to lose hope on the vast and rugged mountain. 
                </p>

                <div class="gif" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/elijah-designs/elijah-designs.github.io@main/content/00099-169725488.png"></div>

            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p> Just when Kai had almost lost hope, a snow leopard emerged from the ridge below. 
                    Fear gripped him, but he couldn't help but admire the creature's beauty and grace. 
                    In a desperate attempt to survive, Kai tried to use his bare hands to fight the snow leopard, 
                    but it proved ineffective against the wild animal. It grabbed hold of him with its wicked claws.
                    Kai prepared to breath his last breath. Any moment the yowling cat would break through his 
                    arms and take his head in it’s massive jaws, and crush his skull. But at the last moment, 
                    a majestic mountain goat charged at the leopard, its horns goring its ribs. 
                    The two animals tumbled down the mountain, their fates uncertain. 
                    Inspired by the raw power and valor of these creatures, Kai pressed onward with newfound courage, 
                    grateful for the unexpected intervention.

                <h5>Rescue</h5>
                <p> Weary and cold, Kai finally stumbled upon a village nestled in the mountains. 
                    The villagers, dressed in animal hides, lived in huts ingeniously constructed 
                    from ice and stone masonry. They cautiously welcomed Kai, intrigued by the stranger 
                    with odd clothing. Over a campfire that night, Kai warmed his frozen limbs. He was 
                    fortunate to only have specs of frostbite gnawing at his toes. The people shared stories of 
                    their lives, their struggles, and their dreams, and Kai felt a deep connection to these 
                    people who seemed so immersed in their humble lives.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p> The village shaman, sensing Kai's transience, bestowed him with incantations 
                    that would give him strength, speed, and mental fortitude. They gave him dried 
                    foods which they traded with the people of the mountain valley’s far below. 
                    Despite Kai's skepticism, the shaman also gave him a wooden river paddle. 
                    Although it didn't seem useful where they were, the shaman assured Kai that it 
                    would be invaluable where he was going. As Kai rested and regained his strength, 
                    he learned from the shaman about a distant land that held the key to his journey home. 
                    The shaman spoke of an ancient artifact, the Tri-Lobed Disc of Sabu, hidden within 
                    a forgotten temple, that could harness the power of time itself.

            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <h5>Departure</h5>
                <p> With the wisdom of the shaman and the friendship of the villagers, Kai prepared to disembark. 
                    They said their goodbyes and set off, determined to find the artifact and return to their own 
                    time. Along the way, Kai would face countless challenges and form unexpected alliances, but 
                    their experiences on Mount Everest had taught them the power of resilience and the importance 
                    of forging connections in a world that could often seem cold and unforgiving
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p> In the end, Kai's journey would not only span continents and millennia but also explore the 
                    depths of the human spirit, revealing that even in the face of insurmountable odds, there is 
                    always hope, and that the true strength of humanity lies in its ability to adapt, persevere, 
                    and ultimately triumph.
