                <h3>My Personal Manifesto </h3>
                <h5>(Edited with the assistance of open.ai's ChatGPT)</h5>
                <p> I am a creative and adventurous person, driven by a passion for hands-on activities and the desire to explore new worlds. From photography and rock climbing to training dogs and crafting, I am constantly seeking new challenges and ways to learn and grow.
                    
                    I value diversity and individuality, and believe that everyone has something unique and valuable to contribute to the world. I strive to be open-minded and accepting of others, and to constantly seek out new perspectives and experiences.
                    
                    In my pursuit of excellence, I will not be limited by traditional ways of thinking or be defined by the expectations of others. I will embrace my creativity and follow my passions, regardless of whether they are considered "objectively driven" or "scientific."
                    
                    I am a lifelong learner and will continue to seek out new experiences and knowledge, always striving to be the best version of myself. I am excited for the journey ahead and the opportunities it will bring.</p>
