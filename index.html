            <h3>My Personal Manifesto</h3>
            <p> I am Elijah Hansen-Lints, and I am grateful to have been born in the beautiful city of Bellevue, Washington. From an early age, I have had the opportunity to explore and experience the natural beauty of the northwest, from the ocean breezes and conifer forests of Bellingham and Lumi, to the snowy landscapes and outdoor adventures of the Methow Valley. These experiences have given me a deep appreciation for the outdoors and for hands-on activities, and have shaped me into the person I am today.

I am driven by a desire to share these types of experiences with others, as I believe they are becoming increasingly rare in a society that often values comfort and speed above all else. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to participate in these activities and am passionate about preserving and promoting them for future generations.

I also recognize that my identity is shaped by both traditional and modern experiences. While I have a strong connection to nature and traditional ways of living, I am also a product of modern society and am dependent on technologies such as fossil fuels and the internet. I strive to find a balance between these different aspects of myself, and to live a fulfilling and meaningful life that incorporates both my traditional and modern passions. Whether it be through crocheting with wooden crochet hooks or acquiring computational skills, I am determined to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way.
